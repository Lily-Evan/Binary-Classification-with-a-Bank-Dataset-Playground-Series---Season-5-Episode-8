Kaggle Playground Series S5E8 – Bank Term Deposit Prediction
This repository contains my solution for the Kaggle Playground Series - Season 5, Episode 8 competition.
The goal was to predict whether a client would subscribe to a bank term deposit, based on a synthetically generated dataset inspired by real-world banking data.
